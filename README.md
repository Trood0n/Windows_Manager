# Windows_Manager

A little script is useful.

For use, you need to install AutoHotkey V2. this is a link : https://www.autohotkey.com/

This is a demo of my script: 

Usage: 

- Alt + S Save the current window and add her to a list of windows affected by Ctrl + M.

- Ctrl + M shows or unshows all windows in the list. 

Download my script, put it in an accessible folder, and double-click on it. 

Enjoy!
